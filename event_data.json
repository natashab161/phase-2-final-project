In partnership with The Links, Incorporated, the Black Women in Cyber Initiative is the new program by OHUB that will work to advance the number and proportion of Black women in the field of cybersecurity. The initiative will provide early exposure, expert-led training, employer-recognized certificates, and resources that will prepare women for the high-growth field of cybersecurity.Why Now?According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is expected to reach six trillion dollars by the end of this year and $10.5 trillion dollars by 2025. Even as companies boost their digital security teams to stay safe online, there are still disproportionately fewer women and people of color in cybersecurity roles.

      "description": "Past research has mostly explored family and friends\u2019 experience from the perspective of giving support to enable the recovery of the \u2018patient\u2019, reinforcing a biomedical view of psychosis. This view sees involvement of family and friends of value only in service to the clinical team, with little insight into family and friends\u2019 own experiences or process, or understanding of the dynamic of mutual affect and interdependence of the family and social system. The findings from a research study - which surveyed 60 family members and friends and interviewed 10 in depth - expand our understanding of family and friends\u2019 experience as valid in its own right; bring insight into the domains of experience family and friends encounter, and describe their potential journey through experiences of chaos and calm. The research explores the possibility of personal growth for family and friends as they meet their own difficult emotions, and looks at the impact on the whole family system.Our hope is that the findings will support better understanding of, and more compassionate interactions with family and friends by clinical teams and others, while empowering family and friends to find meaning, to self-care effectively and to access appropriate and timely support for themselves.\tC\ufeffan't make it live?

America was built upon racism and is a part of all systems and structures. In order to eliminate racism, white America must solve this problem. The Black community is critical in giving whites and other non-Blacks the TRUE history of America, and the racist experience of Black people. The first step is to acknowledge white privilege, and the privileges afforded to other non-whites striving to be accepted in whiteness. To do that, we invite you to join us during the next \"Come Meet A Black Person\" networking event where whites and other non-Blacks interact genuinely with a group of diverse Black people. \"Come Meet A Black Person\" is an open forum for humans to start better relationships with each other across cultural and racial differences. As part of the event, we give three short privilege tests during the \"Come Meet A Black Person\" Anti-Racism Series. measuring the life experiences of people of the world based on the functionality of racism in America and the world. White Privilege Test is for all races, and ethnicities. Non-Black Privilege Test is for all non-Black races EXCEPT white people. (NEW)Black Privilege Test is for all races and ethnicities that IDENTIFY as BLACK. (NEW)\"Come Meet A Black Person\" is open to all races and cultures,  and includes guest speakers, interactive questionnaires, open conversations and an awesome group of participants.

The story of the Clotilda was most recently told in Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s Barracoon: The Story of the Last Black Cargo. Published in 2018, almost 90 years after Hurston wrote it, her book -- \"Barracoon\" -- is based on interviews with the last known surviving descendant of the 1860 voyage, Cudjoe Lewis. \"Barracoon\" put to paper an oral history that has been told for generations, and its belated publication helped lead to the recent discovery of the wrecked ship. https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/descendant-documentary-trailer5\ufeff/14/2023 - White Women: Part of the Problem and Solution to  Ending Racism 6\ufeff/11/2023 - Why Are Black Men the Target of White Supremacy/Racism Anger?7/9/2023 -\ufeff White Privilege: The Tailwind of Racism8\ufeff/13/2023 - Non-Black Privilege of Racism9\ufeff/10/2023 - The Headwinds of White Privilege: The B\ufefflack Experience in America10/8/2023 - Using Content Creation and Social Media Engagement to Disarm Racism1\ufeff1/1`2/2023 - Mainstream Media: The Racism Instigator1\ufeff2/10/2023 - If Black Lives Don't Matter, Does Your Own Life Really Matter?M\ufeffake A Donation Today!W\ufeffhen you register for your free ticket, please consider supporting our anti-racism efforts by:making a donation to our anti-racism efforts of $5 or more.purchasing a CMABP White Ally Tool Kit for $20.

      "description": "OverviewThe Black Women in Cybersecurity Initiative (BWiC) is a new initiative to promote gender and racial equity in Tech by working to increase the number of Black women in Cybersecurity. In partnership with The Links, Incorporated, the Black Women in Cyber Initiative is the new program by OHUB that will work to advance the number and proportion of Black women in the field of cybersecurity. The initiative will provide early exposure, expert-led training, employer-recognized certificates, and resources that will prepare women for the high-growth field of cybersecurity.Why Now?According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is expected to reach six trillion dollars by the end of this year and $10.5 trillion dollars by 2025. Even as companies boost their digital security teams to stay safe online, there are still disproportionately fewer women and people of color in cybersecurity roles. The new initiative by OHUB will provide women of color greater access to cybersecurity training, which will empower them to be job-ready and become strong contributors to the field.

      "description": "Past research has mostly explored family and friends\u2019 experience from the perspective of giving support to enable the recovery of the \u2018patient\u2019, reinforcing a biomedical view of psychosis. This view sees involvement of family and friends of value only in service to the clinical team, with little insight into family and friends\u2019 own experiences or process, or understanding of the dynamic of mutual affect and interdependence of the family and social system. The findings from a research study - which surveyed 60 family members and friends and interviewed 10 in depth - expand our understanding of family and friends\u2019 experience as valid in its own right; bring insight into the domains of experience family and friends encounter, and describe their potential journey through experiences of chaos and calm. The research explores the possibility of personal growth for family and friends as they meet their own difficult emotions, and looks at the impact on the whole family system.Our hope is that the findings will support better understanding of, and more compassionate interactions with family and friends by clinical teams and others, while empowering family and friends to find meaning, to self-care effectively and to access appropriate and timely support for themselves.\tC\ufeffan't make it live?

      "description": "\"Come Meet A Black Person\" Anti-Racism SeriesRacism -- white supremacy -- is at the forefront of all conversations today in this country. America was built upon racism and is a part of all systems and structures. In order to eliminate racism, white America must solve this problem. The Black community is critical in giving whites and other non-Blacks the TRUE history of America, and the racist experience of Black people. The first step is to acknowledge white privilege, and the privileges afforded to other non-whites striving to be accepted in whiteness. To do that, we invite you to join us during the next \"Come Meet A Black Person\" networking event where whites and other non-Blacks interact genuinely with a group of diverse Black people. \"Come Meet A Black Person\" is an open forum for humans to start better relationships with each other across cultural and racial differences. As part of the event, we give three short privilege tests during the \"Come Meet A Black Person\" Anti-Racism Series. measuring the life experiences of people of the world based on the functionality of racism in America and the world. White Privilege Test is for all races, and ethnicities. Non-Black Privilege Test is for all non-Black races EXCEPT white people. (NEW)Black Privilege Test is for all races and ethnicities that IDENTIFY as BLACK. (NEW)\"Come Meet A Black Person\" is open to all races and cultures,  and includes guest speakers, interactive questionnaires, open conversations and an awesome group of participants. We will interact in discussions,  #RacismTalkRooms and #BlackExperienceRooms as we do our part in eradicating racism in America.

Do You Support Reparations to American Descendants of Slaves? We're going to watch the movie \"Descendants\" -- the documentary detailing the Clotilda, the last slave ship in the United States. The story of the Clotilda was most recently told in Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s Barracoon: The Story of the Last Black Cargo. Published in 2018, almost 90 years after Hurston wrote it, her book -- \"Barracoon\" -- is based on interviews with the last known surviving descendant of the 1860 voyage, Cudjoe Lewis. \"Barracoon\" put to paper an oral history that has been told for generations, and its belated publication helped lead to the recent discovery of the wrecked ship. https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/descendant-documentary-trailer5\ufeff/14/2023 - White Women: Part of the Problem and Solution to  Ending Racism 6\ufeff/11/2023 - Why Are Black Men the Target of White Supremacy/Racism Anger?7/9/2023 -\ufeff White Privilege: The Tailwind of Racism8\ufeff/13/2023 - Non-Black Privilege of Racism9\ufeff/10/2023 - The Headwinds of White Privilege: The B\ufefflack Experience in America10/8/2023 - Using Content Creation and Social Media Engagement to Disarm Racism1\ufeff1/1`2/2023 - Mainstream Media: The Racism Instigator1\ufeff2/10/2023 - If Black Lives Don't Matter, Does Your Own Life Really Matter?M\ufeffake A Donation Today!W\ufeffhen you register for your free ticket, please consider supporting our anti-racism efforts by:making a donation to our anti-racism efforts of $5 or more.purchasing a CMABP White Ally Tool Kit for $20.
