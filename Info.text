# NavBar.jsx 
    - when working in NavBar I tried using  <Switch/> as a parent element  to <Routes>
    - because  <Switch/> is benefical for scalability
    - Without <Switch> all matching routes would be rendered, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors
    - ie: if the route is /users/`${username}, switch makes sure that the user gets to their route instead of another similar one
    - BUT i  am getting an error using <Switch/> likely because we are not on react v6
    - I'm pretty sure  we're on v5 because of how Flatiron set us up
