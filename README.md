## Intro

🎨 This is the first iteration protype of our application dedicated to empowering artists by giving them a space to advertise their events and connect with those who have creative careers. 

👉🏽 This project was built on a tight 4 day deadline by 3 Flatiron Bootcamp students, after only 1 week of learning React!

to get started, make sure you have node installed and run

## The tech behind it

⭐️ We took on the bold move of experimenting with Firebase for our user authorization and utilizing Google Cloud functions to store data, and display Google maps 

👉🏽 As we are wrapping up our final phase of bootcamp, (estimated graduation 06/30/23) we have been refactoring our code to fix some bugs related to exposing our API keys... ya gotta learn somehow

## Our vision

🚀 We plan to continue developing this project and those of similar nature as we share a passion for using technology to empower the arts
